A Flutter app for tracking student attendance with offline-first support, beautiful analytics, and modern UI.

## Features

* **Add & manage subjects** with custom colors
* **Mark attendance**: present, absent, late, excused
* **Offline-first** using Hive database
* **Analytics & charts**: trends, weekly/monthly reports

## ⚠️ Note

This is a **very raw version** (v1.0). It may have **multiple bugs** and could **crash**. Please be patient!
I will update it frequently with fixes and improvements.
